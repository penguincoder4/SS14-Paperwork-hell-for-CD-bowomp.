Part 3 involved student failing to install plasteel the first time, plasteel renforcement was installed in slots 3-7-9, told to redo, redone correctly, student used a box to hold them steady as they welded the plasteel onto the renforced frame. surveyed the frame to get an estimation of failure of 5-6 months.
